<h2>At the centre of any smart city there is big data. This data can be collected from sensors, smart devices, cameras. 
The type of data generated is not structured and therefore harder to analyse, use in a logical way. 
To facilitate this process, big data systems were developed to perform specific tasks which are required to obtain a result 
or reach a decision. For these systems to work efficiently, a system architecture must be put in place.
For example, the main requirement for a city to be smart is to have a well-developed system infrastructure. 
However, this infrastructure can be composed of other little architectures designed for the different sections that form a smart city. 
One such segment would be monitoring air quality. Even when considering just the chemical compounds in the air, a big 
data system architecture must be put in place so that data can be accessed by everyone.  Designing such a system can be challenging 
and expertise from various fields is required to achieve a good network, with a constant need for improvements being necessary.</h2>
