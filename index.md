				<p>I am currently enrolled in a [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/) 
funded Centre for Doctoral Training <img src="0.jpg" alt="Photo of Ana Nicoriciu" align="right" />

 how well data is anonimisized. 

Previously awarded a MSc. in Data Science and Analytics and a BSc. in Economics and Management, 
both from the [The University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/).</p>
