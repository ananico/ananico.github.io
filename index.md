## Introduction 

I am currently enrolled in a [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/) funded Centre for Doctoral Training <img src="0.jpg" alt="Photo of Ana Nicoriciu" align="right" /> programme at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). During the first two years I will further develop my skills in data analysis and programming to then complete my PhD. The focus of my thesis will be data anonimisation for clinical trails; looking for new ways to measure how well data is anonimisized. 

Previously awarded a MSc. in Data Science and Analytics and a BSc. in Economics and Management, both at the [The University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/).
